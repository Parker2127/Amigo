## üéØ Supported Intents

### Emotional Expression
- **express_sadness** - Validates and responds to sadness with empathy
- **express_anxiety** - Provides anxiety support and coping strategies
- **express_anger** - Helps process anger with validation and techniques
- **positive_wellbeing** - Celebrates and reinforces positive emotions

### Therapeutic Requests

- **fallback** - Gentle redirection for unrecognized inputs

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Request Processing Flow
1. **Input Reception** - Dialogflow or web interface sends user message
2. **Intent Detection** - System identifies emotional state and therapeutic need
3. **Handler Routing** - Intent dispatcher routes to specialized handler function
4. **Response Generation** - Handler selects appropriate therapeutic response
5. **Context Management** - Session context updated for conversation continuity
6. **Response Delivery** - Formatted response returned to user interface

### Design Principles
- **Modular Design** - Clear separation of concerns between components
- **Extensible Architecture** - Easy to add new intents and response types
- **Validation-First Approach** - All responses prioritize emotional validation
- **Context Awareness** - Maintains conversation state for personalized support
- **Safety Integration** - Crisis resources prominently available throughout

## üîß Development

### Adding New Intents

1. **Define Intent Handler** in `intent_handlers.py`:
```python
def handle_new_intent(parameters, query_text, session_id, input_contexts):
    responses = get_response_variants('new_intent')
    return {
        'text': random.choice(responses),
        'output_contexts': []
    }
```

2. **Add Response Variants** in `responses.py`:
```python
'new_intent': [
    "First response option...",
    "Second response option...",
    "Third response option..."
]
```

3. **Register Intent** in the `intent_handlers` dictionary:
```python
intent_handlers = {
    # existing intents...
    'new_intent': handle_new_intent,
}
```

### Response Guidelines
- Lead with validation and empathy
- Offer concrete, actionable support
- Maintain hope and encouragement
- Include crisis resources when appropriate
- Use warm, conversational language

### Testing
- Test both webhook and live chat interfaces
- Verify all intent handlers work correctly
- Check response variation randomization
- Test session management and context handling
- Validate crisis resource accessibility

## üö¶ Deployment

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required
SESSION_SECRET=your-secure-secret-key

# Optional
DATABASE_URL=your-database-connection-string
PORT=5000
```

### Production Deployment
The application is configured to run with Gunicorn for production:

```bash
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 --reuse-port --reload main:app
```

### Platform Deployment
- **Replit**: Ready to deploy with included configuration
- **Heroku**: Add `Procfile` with gunicorn command
- **Docker**: Create Dockerfile with Python and Flask setup
- **Cloud Functions**: Adapt webhook endpoint for serverless deployment

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety and Ethical Considerations

### Crisis Resources
- **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** prominently displayed
- **Emergency services (911)** clearly accessible
- Crisis resources integrated throughout interface

### Important Disclaimers
- AMIGO is **not a replacement** for professional mental health treatment
- Users in crisis should contact emergency services or crisis hotlines immediately

- The application maintains user privacy and does not store personal information

### Responsible AI Practices
- Responses focus on validation and support rather than diagnosis
- System avoids providing medical or clinical advice
- Crisis situations are redirected to professional resources
- User safety is prioritized in all response design
